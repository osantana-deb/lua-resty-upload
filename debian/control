Description: Lua Resty Upload module for the nginx embedded Lua language
 This modules reads streaming and parse HTTP file uploading based on ngx_lua
 cosocket.
 .
 Because this module is based on the ngx_lua's cosocket API, it inherits
 the advantage of a real nonblocking behaviour running effectively on the
 underlying nginx server ultra-fast technology design, allowing Web
 developers making use of the Lua programming language to script and
 construct extremely high-performance web applications capable to handle
 10K+ connections.
 .
 Note that this module works for both nginx (provided by nginx-extras or
 nginx-custom) and the OpenResty bundle.
